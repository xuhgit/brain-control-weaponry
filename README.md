* 替换思维，替换思维的过程中人是没有自己的思维的，也就是说别人替你思考。也就是说这个技术可以读写思维，视觉听觉知觉大脑能做到的事情，在感知觉层面，都能被增删改查，可是这个技术存在这么久为什么还在人身上做实验？因为它无法实现改变一个人。
* Replacement thinking, replacement thinking process people do not have their own thinking, that is to say, other people think for you. That is to say, this technology can read and write thinking, visual auditory perceptual brain can do things, in the perceptual level, can be added, deleted, changed and checked, but this technology exists for so long why still do experiments on people? Because it can't change a person.

* 能限制任何大脑的活动区域，如让人在清醒状态下完全不能思考。让人保持植物人的状态。
* It can limit any area of brain activity, such as making a person completely unable to think while awake. Keep people in a vegetative state.

* 如果你生活在中国，或者曾经到过中国，你觉得大数据太了解你了，那么一个可能是你的一切思维都在被异步的传到数据库中，这些数据库中可能有一部分被用在了广告系统。
* If you live in China, or have been to China, and you think big data knows you too well, then one possibility is that all your thoughts are being asynchronously transmitted to the database, and some of these databases may be used in advertising system.

* 视觉信息可以被远程输入的信息完全替换，你闭上眼睛，所有的视觉信息都不是你想到的，而是别人让你想到的。
* Visual information can be completely replaced by information input remotely. When you close your eyes, all the visual information is not what you think of, but what others make you think of.

* 立刻让大脑不能思考，比如立刻进入深度睡眠，这能造成车祸，不能实现阅读和逻辑思维。
* Immediately prevent the brain from thinking, such as entering deep sleep immediately, which can cause car accidents and prevent reading and logical thinking.

* 现在在一部分非自愿接受人体实验的目标人群中正在进行一种实验，这种实验的目的可能在于在能够完全可以远程控制人脑的各种感知觉之后，能不能通过人的介入，实现更高级的认知，思维，情感等替换，在一个目标群体还是在其自身岗位的时候，让其成为中国的傀儡。
* An experiment is currently being carried out among some of the target groups who have involuntarily accepted human experiments. The purpose of this experiment may be to realize whether the various sensory perceptions of the human brain can be completely controlled remotely, and whether it can achieve more advanced functions through human intervention. Replacement of cognition, thinking, emotions, etc., makes a target group become a puppet of China while it is still in its own position.

* 让人立刻进入深度睡眠，更好的提取整个脑活动特征，让传递到脑中的信号和脑活动特征更接近，从而达到在各种状态下被动接受思维内容，思维模式的效用。此信号可以作用于脑中任何一个区域，视觉，听觉，语言，嗅觉，触觉等一切大脑功能区域。你以为是你在思考，其实是别人写到你思维中的让你思考的内容。克隆一次大脑或者读取大脑的数据需要的时间约1小时 - 4小时(我会统计更多的数据来估计整个过程，整个过程就是不断的构建梦境，因为在读取数据过后会有一段时间的睡眠时间，让你忘记整个读取数据的过程，每个到过中国的人，都被收集了睡眠状态下的大脑数据，可以在这些人不知情的状态下替换这个人思考的内容，说出的话。)。
* Let people enter deep sleep immediately, better extract the characteristics of the entire brain activity, and make the signal transmitted to the brain and the characteristics of brain activity closer, so as to achieve the effect of passively accepting thinking content and thinking mode in various states. This signal can act on any area of the brain, including vision, hearing, language, smell, touch and all brain functional areas. You think you are thinking, but it is what someone else wrote into your mind that made you think. I will count more data to estimate the whole process, the whole process is to constantly build dreams, because there will be a period of sleep time after reading the data, so that you forget the whole process of reading the data.

* 它可以控制人或动物说话，决策，四肢活动，拥有数据库，存储一切有价值的大脑思维模式。它的作用有哪些？你可以想到。
* It can control people or animals to speak, make decisions, and move their limbs, and has a database to store all valuable brain thinking patterns. What are its functions? You can imagine.

* 根据距离制造声音，可以覆盖原来的声音，比如地铁报站，该制造的声音通过声波传递，具体见 https://youtu.be/aWx0Es-HFe8 可以让人快速浅睡眠，根据浅睡眠状态的大脑环境模拟梦境，输入的图像让人看到东西。
* According to the distance to create sound, can override the original sound, such as the underground station announcement, the manufactured sound through the sound wave transmission, see https://youtu.be/aWx0Es-HFe8  It can make people fast light sleep, according to the light sleep state of the brain environment to simulate the dream, with the input image to make people see things.

* 如果是通过脑神经上的微粒来增删改查脑部活动信息，那么可以hack这些微粒，只要是技术就一定有破绽。
* If it is through the particles on the brain to add, delete and check the brain activity information, then you can hack these particles, as long as the technology must have broken.

* targeted individual （目标人）的所有电子设备都被监控，篡改。
* All of the targeted individual's electronic devices are being monitored and tampered with.

（每个人都有不同的脑电波频率组合特征码，在计算机分析后，按照特定的频率组合特征码制作出特定的脑电波信号，以模拟该脑电波信号的电磁波发射向人脑，就会实现思维的植入。如果发射强度大，就会覆盖人体原始脑电波信号，从而实现脑控。
更加秘密和更具科技含量的脑电波脑控迫害 - 突然一个外来的思维打入思想，和目标人进行交流。这个思维可以让人自己觉得自己要去跳楼和做其它一些非常危险的事情。这是另一种秘密的迫害方式－－脑电波思维植入即脑控迫害。

Each person has a different brain wave frequency combination feature code, after computer analysis, according to the specific frequency combination feature code to produce a specific brain wave signal, to simulate the brain wave signal electromagnetic wave emission to the human brain, it will achieve the implantation of thinking. If the intensity of the emission is high, it will cover the original brain wave signal of the human body, thus realising brain control.

More secretive and more technological brainwave brain control persecution - Suddenly an alien mind hits the mind and communicates with the target person. This thought can make the person themselves feel like they are going to jump off a building and do some other very dangerous things. This is another secret form of persecution ¬- brainwave thought implantation or brain control persecution.

电磁波长期辐射人体会使体内铁分子发生游离、震荡、分解，主要的特征是血像呈现白血球、红血球数量下降，血液中的铁分子大量消失。同时对免疫系统造成损伤，心率加快、血压降低，甚至使人体细胞发生癌变。

Electromagnetic wave radiation for a long time will make the iron molecules in the body free, shock, decomposition, the main characteristic is that the blood image shows white blood cells, the number of red blood cells decreased, and a large number of iron molecules in the blood disappeared. At the same time, it damages the immune system, accelerates the heart rate, lowers the blood pressure, and even causes cancerous changes in human cells.）
